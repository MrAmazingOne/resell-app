roject Overview: AI-Powered Resale Valuation & Listing App

This project is an iOS application that enables users to identify physical items, evaluate their real-time market value and resale potential, and list them for sale—directly from one or more photos.

The app serves as a high-confidence resale engine, using computer vision, AI agents, and live market data to remove guesswork and maximize profit in resale, collectibles, antiques, and arbitrage markets.

Core User Experience (End-to-End Flow)
1. Image Capture & Selection

Users can provide images in multiple ways:

Take a photo in-app

Select one or more photos from the photo library

Select multiple images of the same item to improve identification accuracy

Enable “Multi-Item Mode” to:

Extract multiple distinct items from a single image, or

Process multiple items across multiple images

The app uses iOS “Lift Subject from Image” to isolate individual objects for focused analysis.

The system does not require a single image — more images increase identification confidence and valuation accuracy.

2. Optional User Input

Users may optionally add:

Title hints

Short descriptions

Condition notes

This information assists the AI agent in refining search accuracy but is never required.

Vision + AI Two-Stage Identification System
Stage 1: iOS Vision Framework (Pre-Processing)

Performs on-device object detection and categorization

Extracts visual features and bounding regions

Supports subject isolation and multi-item extraction

Reduces backend processing time

Prevents render request timeouts (30s execution / 50s spin-down)

Stage 2: Backend AI Agent

The AI agent receives:

One or more cropped images per item

Vision framework metadata

Optional user-provided text

It performs:

Item identification (brand, model, year, category)

Market matching

Valuation analysis

Resale potential evaluation

Backend Processing & Market Intelligence

The backend asynchronously:

Queries eBay API for:

Recent sold listings

Active listings

Price distributions

Market liquidity

Calculates:

Average sale price

Lowest and highest historical prices

Estimated resale price

Cost vs. profit opportunity

Demand and trend signals

The frontend polls for completion to avoid timeout failures.

Results Display (Frontend)

Each identified item is presented in a collapsible horizontal card, containing:

Item image

Item name / identification

Market value snapshot

Average lowest price (USD)

Average highest price (USD)

Estimated resale value (USD)

Resell score (overall profit viability gauge)

Rarity / collectibility indicators

Condition impact notes

Trend indicators

Listing status

Important Economic Transparency

All valuation data—including lowest comps and downside pricing—is fully visible to the user.

Sensitive pricing data is only suppressed at the moment of listing, so buyers are not influenced by information that could undermine the sale.

This ensures:

Maximum user intelligence

Maximum listing effectiveness

Resell Score Logic

The Resell Score is an aggregate signal that accounts for:

Cost vs. estimated resale value

Price volatility

Market liquidity

Demand trends

Historical sales velocity

It does not override raw numbers—users always retain full control over economic decisions.

Listing & Inventory Management
Instant eBay Listing

Users may immediately list an item on eBay with one tap.

When listing:

Buyer-facing descriptions exclude sensitive economic data

Listing includes:

Optimized title

High-conversion description

Pricing strategy

Category and keywords

eBay is the initial integration; additional marketplaces (Craigslist, Facebook Marketplace, etc.) will follow.

Saved Inventory System

Users can save items for later listing.

Saved items appear as:

Collapsible horizontal cards

Automatically tracked listing status

Visual indicators:

🟢 Listed

🔴 Not listed

Listed items are automatically saved and updated.

AI Agent Architecture
Primary AI Agent (Always Active)

Responsibilities:

Item identification

Market valuation

Resale potential assessment

Economic confidence scoring

The primary agent always evaluates resale potential, as not all identifiable items are economically viable for resale.

Optional Secondary AI Agent (Context-Driven)

Triggered when beneficial.

Responsibilities:

Trend analysis

Cultural relevance

Media influence

Collectibility momentum

Resale potential analysis by the secondary agent is derived from trend and cultural signals, not duplicated logic.

Technical Architecture (High Level)
Frontend (iOS)

Camera & photo library

iOS Vision + Lift Subject
