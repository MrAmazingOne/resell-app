This is what i'm hoping to accomplish, and we were incorporating vision framework to help prevent timeouts and work around renders 30 second timeout and their 50 second spin down process. In using vision framework to pre-identify the item we should keep very accurate results while also decreasing the search time, similar to a 2 part system. The AI agent still received the image, just includes vision frameworks data. 

This is an app, I can walk up to objects take a photo and receive back detailed information about the item (market, description, item year, as accurately as possible). The user then has the ability to select where to list the item ( ebay, craigslist, facebookmarket ) and post the listing using this information by clicking a button. We are hoping to utilize iOS lift feature so we can easily crop multiple items out of a single image. The user should be able to open the app, take a picture, select a picture (possibly multiple of a single item), or select multi-objects in a single picture using the lift feature. We are including the ability to add optional title / description text to possibly help with agent's search accuracy. Currently we are only trying to utilize ebay integration for simplicity we will focus on other marketplace websites at another simte.

The goal is to have an incredibly profitable reresell business that uses the app as a catalyst. The accuracy of the agent and it's abilities to calculate an items resellability should increase profits in any resell / antique / market, by having the highest certainty of an items true value in TODAYS current market.
