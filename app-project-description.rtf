\f0\fs24 \cf0 This is an app, I can walk up to objects take a photo and receive back detailed information about the item (market, description, item year, as accurately as possible). The user then has the ability to select where to list the item ( ebay, craigslist, facebookmarket ) and post the listing using this information by clicking a button. We are hoping to utilize iOS lift feature so we can easily crop multiple items out of a single image. The user should be able to open the app, take a picture, select a picture (possibly multiple of a single item), or select multi-objects in a single picture using the lift feature. We are including the ability to add optional title / description text to possibly help with agent's search accuracy.\
\
The goal is to have an incredibly profitable reresell business that uses the app as a catalyst. The accuracy of the agent and it's abilities to calculate an items resellability should increase profits in any resell / antique / market, by having the highest certainty of an items true value in TODAYS current market.}
